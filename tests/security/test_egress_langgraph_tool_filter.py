"""Integration tests for the egress-policy PEP that pre-filters the LangGraph
lead-agent tool list in
``advanced_search_system/strategies/langgraph_agent_strategy.py``
(``LangGraphAgentStrategy._build_tools`` specialized-engine loop, ~L608-695).

This is the *silent-expansion* fix. The search-engine factory PEP already
refuses a forbidden engine at instantiation time, but that is a runtime stop:
the LLM still SEES the forbidden tool name in its schema, and the latency of a
denied tool call leaks policy state. Filtering the tool list HERE means a
forbidden engine's name never reaches ``create_agent()`` — the model never
learns it exists. These tests assert exactly that property: which engine names
survive into the built tool list under each scope.

The tests drive the REAL ``_build_tools`` loop and the REAL
``evaluate_engine`` / ``evaluate_retriever`` PDP. Only the leaf tool factories
(``_make_web_search_tool``, ``_make_specialized_search_tool``,
``build_fetch_tool``) and the engine/retriever *discovery* (``list_eligible_engine_configs``,
``retriever_registry``) are mocked — so every assertion is about the FILTER
decision, made before any tool is actually constructed.

Engine classifications come from the live ``ENGINE_REGISTRY``:
  - arxiv / wikipedia : public (is_public=True,  is_local=False)
  - paperless         : local  (is_public=False, is_local=True; no api_url in
                        the snapshot, so no DNS lookup occurs)
  - elasticsearch     : local  (is_public=False, is_local=True; no hosts in
                        the snapshot, so no DNS lookup occurs)

Each scope axis is covered with an allow+deny pair: reverting the filter (or
loosening a scope check) would let a denied name survive (or drop an allowed
one) and flip an assertion.
