"""Follow-up regression tests for ADAPTIVE scope resolution and
``context_from_snapshot`` cross-field coupling (PR #4300 egress policy).

These cover gaps not already exercised by
``tests/security/test_egress_policy.py``:

* ADAPTIVE resolution of *registered retriever* primaries (local => PRIVATE_ONLY,
  public => PUBLIC_ONLY) via the retriever registry path inside
  ``_resolve_adaptive_scope``.
* Stray removed meta-engine names (auto / meta / parallel /
  parallel_scientific) being unclassifiable and resolving to BOTH under
  ADAPTIVE, and leaving STRICT intact (no ValueError) under STRICT.
* The PRIVATE_ONLY -> require_local_llm/require_local_embeddings *coupling* on a
  direct (non-adaptive) PRIVATE_ONLY scope, and the deliberate absence of that
  coupling under STRICT.
* Non-dict snapshot ValueError contract.
* ``allow_dns=False`` skipping ``_resolve_with_timeout`` and falling back to the
  engine's static classification (vs. the DNS-driven result with allow_dns=True).
