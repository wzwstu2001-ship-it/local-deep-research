    SQLAlchemy requires explicit rollback after a failed flush/commit before
    the session is usable again. Skipping it leaves the session in
    PendingRollbackError state and every subsequent ORM operation cascades.

    This helper exists so call sites can recover the session in one line
    without repeating the try/except/log boilerplate at every except handler.
    ``context`` is included in the error log so failed rollbacks can be
    traced back to the call site.

    Two SQLAlchemy error shapes are treated as "the session is structurally
    unusable — give up on it, drop the thread-local cache, and let the next
    caller get a fresh one" rather than as loud failures:

    * ``InvalidRequestError("...provisioning a new connection; concurrent
      operations are not permitted...")`` — the second thread racing on the
      per-user QueuePool.
    * ``InterfaceError("Cursor needed to be reset because of commit/rollback
      and can no longer be fetched from")`` — a cursor was invalidated by a
      commit/rollback that fired between the original ``execute()`` and the
      lazy-attribute fetch that followed.

    In both cases SQLAlchemy has already marked the session unrecoverable, so
    a no-op rollback is correct, the thread-local cache is cleared, and the
    failure is logged at DEBUG so the production stderr stream stays clean.
    Other ``SQLAlchemyError`` failures still hit the loud ``logger.exception``
    path (unless their message matches a known broken-session signature) —
    the session is normally recoverable via rollback and the operator needs
    to see them.
