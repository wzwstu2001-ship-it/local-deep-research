    strategy; it's forwarded to summary-mode fetch tools so the per-page
    extractor sees both the agent's per-fetch focus and the original
    research question.

    ``max_subagent_workers`` bounds the pool size. Surplus subtopics queue
    and start as workers free up; each queued subagent gets its own per-task
    deadline measured from when *it* actually begins executing (not from
    drain-loop start -- see #5014). The value comes from the user setting
    ``langgraph_agent.max_subagent_workers`` and falls back to
    ``MAX_SUBAGENT_WORKERS`` when unset / invalid.

    ``library_resolver`` is threaded into the subagent's fetch tool so a
    subagent researching a library-derived subtopic can also resolve
    ``/library/document/<uuid>`` URLs and ``[N]`` citation markers instead
    of burning the egress-denial quota on them (A3). When ``None``,
    library / citation URLs fall through to the egress gate unchanged.
