    ``LocalEmbeddingManager.embeddings`` is a lazy property that, on first
    access, synchronously loads the real backend (a SentenceTransformer costs
    seconds and hundreds of MB of RSS, an Ollama client opens live httpx
    connections). Handing that property straight to the delete path forces that
    cost once per (deleted-document x collection). This proxy pulls the real
    embeddings from the manager only if ``embed_*`` is genuinely called, so the
    delete path pays nothing while index/search paths still work unchanged.

    atomically with respect to ``acquire`` and ``pop_faiss_locks_for_user``: the
    per-(user, index_path) entry is added when ownership transitions 0 → 1 and
    discarded when it transitions 1 → 0, and both transitions happen under
    ``_faiss_write_locks_lock``.

    Without holding ``_faiss_write_locks_lock`` across release, there would be a
    race window: thread A could release → thread B (blocked in ``acquire``) unblock
    and add its key → thread A then observe depth 0 and discard B's key. With
    ``pop_faiss_locks_for_user`` evicting a "free" lock, the next writer would
    create a fresh lock for the same ``(username, index_path)`` and race B on the
    FAISS file. Holding ``_faiss_write_locks_lock`` across inner release + depth
    check + discard ensures no concurrent acquire's key-add can interleave with

        Index many documents concurrently with bounded fan-out.

        Each per-document task runs the prepared pipeline
        (:meth:`_prepare_document` for load/split/embed, then the
        coordinator's serialized durable write) unless a subclass overrides
        :meth:`_index_one` or :meth:`index_document`, in which case that
        per-doc path is invoked directly — the per-doc logic (split, embed,
        persist chunks, FAISS-merge-under-lock, mark indexed, update stats)
        is unchanged. The bounded fan-out only changes *which* sequential
        loop dispatches the work: before this method, six call sites in
        :mod:`research_library.routes.rag_routes` and the background
        reconciler in :mod:`scheduler.background` each did this one doc at
        a time. The slow embedding round-trip (outside the FAISS write
        lock) is now overlapped across documents.

        Concurrency invariants this method relies on (already true):

            * :meth:`index_document` opens a fresh per-thread DB session via
              :func:`get_user_db_session` — workers do not share sessions.
            * All FAISS mutations go through ``VectorIndex.apply()`` in
              :mod:`local_deep_research.vector_stores`, which is only
              invoked under the per-(username, index_path) write lock
              returned by :func:`_get_faiss_write_lock`. The service passes
              that lock into the vector-store facade at the call sites
              around L422, L879, L1097, and L2025, so concurrent
              ``index_document`` workers serialise their FAISS appends on
              the same lock without any extra coordination here.
            * ``LocalEmbeddingManager.embeddings`` uses double-checked
              locking for first-load.
            * ``is_cancelled`` is polled between completions AND between
              submissions. The bounded-submission loop admits new work into
              the pool only when ``is_cancelled()`` returns False, and
              each :func:`_run_one` worker re-checks ``is_cancelled()``
              immediately before delegating to ``index_document``. This
              closes the false-poll-to-submit gap (the cancel signal can
              be set between the main thread's poll and ``pool.submit()``)
              so post-cancel starts are zero by construction. The final
              ``is_cancelled()`` poll in the ``finally`` block also
              preserves ``cancelled=True`` in the aggregate when the
              signal lands while the last in-flight worker is running.
            * In-flight embedding round-trips cannot be interrupted (Python
              has no safe way to kill a SentenceTransformer forward pass
              mid-array) — they finish naturally before the helper returns
              via ``pool.shutdown(wait=True)``.

        Args:

            collection_id: UUID of the collection.
            force_reindex: Forwarded to :meth:`index_document`.
            max_workers: Bound on the size of the
                ``ThreadPoolExecutor`` — i.e. how many documents can be
                **preparing** concurrently (load + split + embed). It does
                NOT bound the prepared-but-unwritten backlog: completed
                futures hold their full vector batches in memory until the
                coordinator's serial write stage picks them up, so for very
                large batches the resident memory footprint can exceed what
                ``max_workers`` alone suggests. Embedding is the slow stage
                in practice, so this is acceptable for the default 4-worker
                fan-out; a caller with many large documents should either
                shrink ``max_workers`` or chunk the submission. ``1`` falls
                back to fully sequential behaviour (still useful when a
                flaky network makes concurrent httpx calls worse than
                serial). Default 4.
            progress_callback: Optional hook called once per completed
                document with ``(completed, total, title, status)`` —
                matches the legacy shape used by
                :meth:`index_all_documents` so existing UI progress
                paths keep working.
            is_cancelled: Optional zero-arg callable polled between
                completions AND between submissions. When it returns
                ``True``, no further work is admitted into the pool;
                in-flight futures finish naturally. The executor is
                always shut down with ``wait=True`` so no worker can
                outlive the caller's service context.

        Vector-store-only: the DB chunk rows are removed separately by the
        caller. This closes the gap where deleting a document's DB chunks
        left its vectors (and their persisted text — now impossible, see
        vector_stores/base.py's SECURITY INVARIANT) in the store, so the
        document kept surfacing in semantic search until a full reindex.

        For each id, calls ``VectorIndex.delete(source_type="document",
        source_id=...)`` — which looks up the matching ``DocumentChunk``
        rows by (source_type, source_id, collection_name) — UNLESS
        ``chunk_ids_by_document`` supplies that document's chunk ids
        directly, in which case ``VectorIndex.delete_ids(ids)`` is used
        instead. Callers whose own per-item transactions must delete the DB
        rows eagerly (for their own atomicity/rollback semantics) BEFORE
        this batched cleanup runs need the latter: the source_id lookup
        would find nothing once the rows are already gone (see the Zotero
        sync caller). Hardcodes ``source_type="document"``: both current
        callers (Zotero sync cleanup, ``remove_document_from_rag``) only
        ever pass library-document ids (the pre-cutover implementation
        matched a mixed ``document_id``/``source_id`` metadata key
        generically across "document" and "user_document" sources, but
        nothing ever called it with anything but library documents).

        Returns the total number of vectors removed across all ids. No-ops
        (returns 0) when the collection has no current vector index — this
        guard runs BEFORE building a ``VectorIndex`` so a delete call never
        creates one (``_get_vector_index`` would otherwise create the
        RAGIndex row via ``_get_or_create_rag_index``).
