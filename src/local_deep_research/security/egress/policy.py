"""Egress policy module: central PDP for search engines, LLM endpoints,
embeddings, and URL fetches.

This is an in-process correctness guardrail, NOT a hard security boundary.
It defends against honest misconfiguration, prompt-injection-induced
URL fetches, accidental egress, and the LangGraph silent-expansion bug.
It does NOT defend against compromised dependencies, code-execution
in the LDR process, or a determined adversary who can modify the policy
module itself. Operators needing a hard boundary should layer OS-level
controls (network namespaces, firewall rules, restricted Docker).
